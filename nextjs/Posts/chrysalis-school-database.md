This project is built on the Stack on React, Nodejs and MySQL. This project is used by Chrysalis school to keep track of the schools information in a MySQL database but with the convinience of a beautiful frontend UI.

#### Some features of the Projects

##### 1. Offsite Access

The databse is hosted online on digital ocean platforms. This enables 24 hours access to the schools information without the need to be in the school. Information can easily be passed between the different staff members of the school without the need to be within the school. This is especially important since the director normally travels to the UK and needs access to the school information that is always upto date.

##### 2. SQL builder

This functionality allows the users to build complex SQL queries with a UI without the need to actually know SQL syntax. This makes the project accessible to even the users who can read and write and have a basic knowledge and understanding of Technology.

These queries can be Functions, stored procedures, virtual tables and most of the functionalities of the database. These can all be done intuitively on the user interface.

Further more, functions and stored procedures can be saved for future use incase it will be used regularly.

##### 3. Role based table support

This project allows users to create tables. However these tables can be restricted to specific roles or the users can have access to a specific field of the table only. Chrysalis is a unique school in that each staff may have different roles. This functionality makes it possible for users to share information between themselves without the worry that the table may include fields that are private or contain sensitive information.

##### 4. Examination Monitoring support

This project allows the teachers to enter in the results of the students and the grading is automatically calculated. This can also be downloaded from the site for it to be used to create students end of term report cards that are then given to the parents.

##### 5. The Dashboard

The application contains a dashboard that displays different statistics and summaries for the schools information. This dashboard has varying information per user and access rights but can be customized to the users need based on which information is most important to them.

##### 6. The school calendar

This maintains all the schools activities that have been run and will be run in future. This information is easily accessible to all the teachers and staff of the school and events can be changed to display to only the relevant people.

#### Some lessons learnt

##### 1. Programmers, build as much as you can

Without building projects, you will not know your weaknesses and limitations. Each project you build brings new challenges and opportunities to learn new things and things you may not have encountered in a certain technology.

##### 2. Databases are hard to build and maintain

There is so much thought that goes into databases. Simple things like who are the users of this database, when and where can the database fail, what kind of useful information can be needs to be extracted from the data stored in the database.

These simple points informs how you get to build and structure your database, interms of which tables are created, what fields are there and when you should probably break a field or group of fields into its own tables.

##### 3. How good you are in programming doesnot matter

Here me out here, when you are the best at programming, your value is then determined by the problems you solve for your company and how well you relate to the stakeholders inorder to understand their business needs.

A lot of the times the stakeholders don't want to know what technology you have used, all they want is a working product that is to there specification. It is your job to choose what tech stack you will use or if they are technically educated, then it becomes your responsibility to share with them some of the potential limitations of the technology stack and some ways of circumventing it or some tradeoffs. This should be done on the offset of a project.
