### This site

This is my first post for this site. A simple blog site where I will from now on start writing some interesting things that I do. It may not be very frequently but it will be as much as I find time for.

This website was an ispiration from the [Gates Notes](https://www.gatesnotes.com/) and the looks is an inspiration from the [Odyssey Astro theme](https://github.com/littlesticks/odyssey-theme/).

I must admit I have taken a while without reading anything other than documentation. So this will be an outlet for some of my creations and thoughts on concepts.

I will mainly be writing about programming, robotics, star trek and some physics and maths. Hopefully the concepts I post will be read and understood and people will appreciate them. I will try my best to keep away from politics and controversial topics that vary from different countries.

This will basically be my small corner of the internet. An outlet for me and my thoughts.

Happy reading.
