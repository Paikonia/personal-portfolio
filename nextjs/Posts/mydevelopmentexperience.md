#### Background on development

My development journey has been a long one. Started with a programming language that many in the community would like to hate, Java.

My coming to programming has been I long twisted journey.

##### First things first

First and foremost, I appreciate that the first programming language I learnt was Java, and the book I used to learn was [], arguably the best book for the language. Lets first leave out the android programming and talk about C. The second Language I learnt was C and this was perhaps one of the best decisions I made.

In this journey, I had a mentour Martin, who is studied his Computer Science course from the University of Seoul. He guided me through the best practices, what can be clean readable code and how to use github to share code and collaborate with others on the same project. I also managed to do small projects that he assigned to me and I really appreciate his contribution in my development in programming.

##### What I learnt from learning C

It would be natural for me to start with some of the things I learnt while learning Java since it was the first language I learnt but I will get to that in a bit.

The first and most important thing I learned was the interaction of code and the computer. C is obviously a compiled language and can be compiled to different states. But being compiled did not mean that it worked in every environment. I used to think that when I write a Java program, that it was a given that it would run in all environment provided the underlaying systems had some common principle(hardware). Forexaple, a software written in Java automatically runs on all platforms. What I however failed to understand was that, the Java runtime was written for the different platforms and compiled separately. A code written and compiled on Windows will not run on Linux or MacOS or androud unless compiled seperately on the different platforms.

However, the above rant may seem to be completely useless until you realise that all programming labguages can be written for the different platforms but there is always an API that is written seperately for the different platforms. A simple example I can give is an application written in JavaScript will run on most platforms with very little difference due to hardware limitations forexample screen size. However, the interpretor is always written for that specific platform. V8 engine is supported by most platforms.
